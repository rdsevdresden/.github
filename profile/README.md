<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, We're Ritter der Schwafelrunde e.V.</h1>
🙋‍The Ritter der Schwafelrunde e.V. is a theater club which was founded in 2021 by 13 friends after they had grown out of a school project. Within the framework of this school project, they established their enthusiasm for this art form through the performance of several plays in various constellations, which forms the basis for our current association.<br>
